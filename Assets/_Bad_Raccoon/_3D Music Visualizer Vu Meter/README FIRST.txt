UPDATE 1.1 
-----------

Rewriten from scratch… We do some shit sometime :) I re-thinked a more extensible system.
More visualizer added, the new structure permit some very cool visualizer :) 

I hope you like them :)

Now visualizer size is lerped (smoothed) with channel volume information for a smoother
effect. A small tool is included : _Debug_Channel_Tool, this small helper is created to 
help you to see what is the better beat channel for a music. 

You select the channel (bottom of the window) and the circle in the center of the screen
change of size with this new channel beat.

This channel number can be used into the script : « SpectrumSize » in the case « Audio Channel »
This script is an exemple of object sizing with a channel beat.

Some functions using this tool are planned, for the moment don’t care about it :)

-----------
FOR NOOBS :
-----------

To change the music : Select the game object named « Spectrum manager » and drop another music
In the « audio source » component  

Take a look too in the directory _For NOOBS
